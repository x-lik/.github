## ðŸ‘‹ Hello !

</p>

ðŸš€ x-lik is the extreme version of the lik framework. The most powerful lua mapping framework ever, it runs on windows
platform. It is dedicated to solving the problems contained in lik, it combines YD, Dz, kk and other runtime
environments, and create its own runtime environment, to play a unique concept, both powerful and free. It also runs in
a completely safe environment, so that the problem of player desynchronization no longer occurs when the game is
running!

It supports the most advanced map hot update, the most intelligent global code obfuscation encryption (even Chinese),
and has made new optimizations for sound effects and other things that can accurately prompt the user about misuse and
lack of resources. It also greatly improves runtime performance.

### ðŸ›¸ Let's see what makes it special:

* Multiple example projects, quick reference to get started.
* Usage habits are 20% similar to h-lua, 70% similar to singluar, 95% similar to lik, low learning cost.
* Include and update all the past framework features, convenient and quick
* Fix all the bugs in the history of all the past frameworks.
* Optimize the defects of all frameworks in the past, such as the loss of shift commands.
* The structure of each level is clearer and more friendly to customize.
* Extremely safe running mechanism to solve asynchronous problems.
* Huge common libraries, covering 99% of the usage scenarios.
* Better JAPI library, including commercial APIs.
* Multi-categorized class library, many new UI classes, greatly improved performance and support for multiple
  inheritance.
* more convenient and intelligent obfuscation settings (precisely assigned to each library encrypt.json)
* more excellent and robust development environment once and for all
* more accurate and more concise assets resource data configuration
* clearer debug information, quickly locate the problem
* Includes excellent sound and up-to-date development environment

ðŸŒˆ Use this framework , you can solve all the problems of the old framework . Framework encapsulates all the functions and methods that need to be used . In addition , also supports the insertion of sub-libraries and extension libraries , support for different libraries of obfuscation , so that users can quickly write business , separation of their business logic . The whole project is now closed for testing and will be decided based on sponsorship.
