</p>

ðŸš€ The x-lik is a unique concept that has undergone significant performance improvements. It is a re-built version based on the past LIK framework and can run on the Windows platform. It has various API interfaces such as YD, Dz, kk, etc., and has a unique completely safe running environment, ensuring that no player asynchronous problems will occur during the game. It supports the most advanced map hot update and the most intelligent code obfuscation encryption, even supporting Chinese code obfuscation. It has also innovated and optimized multiple functional modules such as resource files, sound effects, UI, etc.

### ðŸ›¸ Let's see what makes it special:

* Multiple example projects, quick reference to get started.
* Usage habits are 20% similar to h-lua, 60% similar to singluar, 90% similar to lik, low learning cost.
* Include and update all the past framework features, convenient and quick
* Fix all the bugs in the history of all the past frameworks.
* Optimize the defects of all frameworks in the past, such as the loss of shift commands.
* The structure of each level is clearer and more friendly to customize.
* Extremely safe running mechanism to solve asynchronous problems.
* Huge common libraries, covering 99% of the usage scenarios.
* Better JAPI library, including commercial APIs.
* Multi-categorized class library, many new UI classes, greatly improved performance and support for multiple
  inheritance.
* more convenient and intelligent obfuscation settings (precisely assigned to each library encrypt.json)
* more excellent and robust development environment once and for all
* more accurate and more concise assets resource data configuration
* clearer debug information, quickly locate the problem
* Includes excellent sound and up-to-date development environment
