## 👋 Hello !

帮我用英文写200词介绍x-lik版本。它有独特的概念，性能得到巨大的提升，是基于过去lik框架的重新构建，可以在windows平台上运行。它拥有YD、Dz、kk等多种api接口，并拥有独特的完全安全运行环境，保证游戏进行时就不会再出现玩家异步问题。支持最先进的地图热更新。支持最智能的代码混淆加密，甚至支持中文代码混淆。对资源文件、音效处理、UI等多个功能模块进行了革新优化。

🚀 The x-lik is a unique concept that has undergone significant performance improvements. It is a re-built version based on the past LIK framework and can run on the Windows platform. It has various API interfaces such as YD, Dz, kk, etc., and has a unique completely safe running environment, ensuring that no player asynchronous problems will occur during the game. It supports the most advanced map hot update and the most intelligent code obfuscation encryption, even supporting Chinese code obfuscation. It has also innovated and optimized multiple functional modules such as resource files, sound effects, UI, etc.

### 🛸 Let's see what makes it special:

* Multiple example projects, quick reference to get started.
* Usage habits are 20% similar to h-lua, 60% similar to singluar, 90% similar to lik, low learning cost.
* Include and update all the past framework features, convenient and quick
* Fix all the bugs in the history of all the past frameworks.
* Optimize the defects of all frameworks in the past, such as the loss of shift commands.
* The structure of each level is clearer and more friendly to customize.
* Extremely safe running mechanism to solve asynchronous problems.
* Huge common libraries, covering 99% of the usage scenarios.
* Better JAPI library, including commercial APIs.
* Multi-categorized class library, many new UI classes, greatly improved performance and support for multiple
  inheritance.
* more convenient and intelligent obfuscation settings (precisely assigned to each library encrypt.json)
* more excellent and robust development environment once and for all
* more accurate and more concise assets resource data configuration
* clearer debug information, quickly locate the problem
* Includes excellent sound and up-to-date development environment
